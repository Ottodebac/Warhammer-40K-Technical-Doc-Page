        <article>
          <p>
            Aside from Gameplay and Hobbying, the third reason that people love
            the Warhammer 40k universe is the lore, or the story of the setting,
            but getting started in Warhammer 40k lore can be daunting because
            there’s just so much of it. If you think worlds like Middle Earth
            are expansive, they’ve got nothing on Warhammer 40k, and that’s
            because for 30 years dozens of authors have been writing hundreds of
            novels about it. The Warhammer 40k universe is BIG.
          </p>
          <p>
            So where do we get started? In this article on getting started in
            Warhammer 40k lore I’m going to go through a general timeline of
            lore and, when we get to a certain points, I’m going to point you to
            Warhammer 40k novels. Note that I’m not going to be going into a LOT
            of detail about every faction here, but that’s because I’ll be going
            into more detail on each when we get into then Getting Started
            guides for each faction. For now if you want to read more about each
            faction, here’s an article The Warhammer 40k Races, one on the
            Warhammer 40k factions, and one each on the Space Marines and the
            Chaos Space Marines. I’ll be linking to other articles as we go.

              The beginning of the Warhammer 40k universe begins with origin of
              the C’tan, who are also sometimes referred to as the Star Gods.
              The C’tan were beings of energy who didn’t have physical forms but
              instead existed near stars leaching the power emanating from the
              stars for their strength. They were powerful, but only
              semi-sentient and didn’t interact with the world or other races
              much.
            </li>
            <li>
              Next on the scene came the Old Ones. Not much is known about the
              Old Ones, except that they were an extremely powerful reptilian
              race that was nearly immortal and highly technologically advanced.
              The Old Ones had done one thing very important, which was to
              create (or use; it’s unclear) the Webway. The Webway is a way to
              move through space faster than light without entering the
              dangerous Warp.

          60 Million Years Pass: The Power of the Aeldari and the Rise of

            In the absence of these major groups, the Aeldari rose to prominence
            in the galaxy to the point where they were the most powerful and
            reigned nearly uncontested for millions of years. The Aeldari were a
            psychic race and they were able to make great use of the Webway
            allowing them to spread through the galaxy, to conquer and populate.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Skipping forward, humanity rose to become a power, somewhere
              around 40,000 years before present, in what is know as the Age of
              Terra. Humanity was a small race but were starfaring and had begun
              to terraform planets within the Earth’s solar system.
            </li>
            <li>
              Among the humans was a man who would become the Emperor of
              Mankind. He had lived for thousands of years, being born perhaps
              6000 years prior. But the man who would be Emperor lived quietly
              in the shadows.

        <article>
          <p>
            The Aeldari had become so powerful that they essentially ran out of
            places to conquer. The human civilization was still nothing compared
            to the Aeldari. The Aeldari began to grow decadent and vile, finding
            it harder and harder to get pleasure out of life so they became
            hedonistic and found their joy in excess.
          </p>
          <p>
            This nearly wiped out the Aeldari. Some had left the larger group of
            Aeldari early–the Exodites–or they sought refuge on Craftworlds,
            massive world-sized ships. The Aeldari would lose their place as the
            leading power in the galaxy and be a broken and disjointed
            civilization. While some resisted Slaanesh (“She Who Thirsts”) and
            became the Craftworld Eldar, others gave into the pleasure of the
            God of Excess and became the Drukhari (also known as the Dark
            Eldar).

      <section class="main-section" id="Great_Crusade">
        <header>The Great Crusade and the Rise of the Emperore</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            It was during the Age of Strife that the man who would be Emperor came to power. The greatest psyker in human history and essentially immortal, the Emperor of Mankind sought to reunite all of humanity, and he began work on a Great Crusade to do just that.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Emperor created 20 Primarchs, his “sons” who were superhumans all having his DNA. He intended the Primarchs to lead the Great Crusade but they were accosted by the powers of Chaos and spread across the galaxy while still children. The Emperor then used the DNA of the Primarchs to created 20 legions of Space Marines, transhuman warriors of great power. He also made a treaty with the Cult Mechanicum, who were based on Mars, and who led the entire Imperium of Man in manufacturing and technology. The Emperor was against the concept of religion, but in the Treaty of Mars he allowed the Cult Mechanicum to continue their worship of the Machine God.

          <p>
            However, the reunification of the Primarchs was not going to bring peace, even though it did bring all of humanity together under one banner–the Imperium. The Emperor made Horus the Warmaster and then returned to earth to work on a secret project that he did not divulge to his sons. This was seen as a betrayal by some. (The project was to work on creating a Webway so that the Imperium wouldn’t need to travel through the Warp.)
          </p>
          <p>
            But, worse than this betrayal, Horus was corrupted by Chaos, wounded by a Chaos-tainted blade from Nurgle, a wound that could not heal. In an effort to save his own life he fell further into the clutches of Chaos. One by one, Horus was able to draw eight other Space Marine Legions and their Primarchs under his command.
